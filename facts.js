    "There exist a wide variety of safe practices that can help your servo or thopter function happily in its new role.",
    "Since servo and thopter directions are imprinted at creation, it is recommended that artificers assist your constructs in adapting.",
    "The Consulate banned the use of kitchen thopters after what came to be known as The Grand Conflagration, about three years ago.",
    "There is an ongoing linguistic debate over whether the sound of a thopter’s wing is “thop” or “thwop”.",
    "A common misconception is that thopters enter hibernation in the spring. This is untrue, as thopters do not require sleep.",
    "Did you know: to protect its citizens from incendiary dangers, the Consulate has deployed 36% more thopters than last week.",
    "Thank you for your patience. We now return this network to its regularly-scheduled pieces of thopter trivia",
    "Though a popular engineering experiment, pedal-powered thopters rarely more than slow a fatal descent.",

    "Famed eccentric artificer Kolis Derava wrote an essay detailing 57 thopter construction methods. Upon inspection, only 2 of them could fly.",
    "Stunt thopters are sometimes fitted with aether propulsion systems to assist them through maneuvers. Without such systems, loops and spectacular aether-infused crashes would surely be impossible.",
    "Famed eccentric artificer Kolis Derava once claimed to have created completely organic thopters. They were, upon closer inspection, flies.",

    "If you forget the components necessary to construct a thopter, just use the C.O.G.W.E.L.L. mnemonic. C.O.G.W.E.L.L. stands for Chassis, Orbiter, Gears, Wings, Energy, Lead, and License. Filigree, while optional, is highly recommended.",

    "Factory Servos are built with a tracking device so that, if stolen or missing, they can be located. This feature is rarely, if ever, used.",
    "If Servos were considered alive, they would then have the opportunity to gain more rights as Kaladeshi denizens, such as the right to vote. Voting rights are given to all living constructs in Kaladesh. Regulating which constructs were sapient prooved too cumbersome. However, choosing which constructs were considered legally alive proved to be an effective alternative.",
    "Servos can come in a variety of standardized designs. However, while personal repair and modification is discouraged, it is not yet illegal.",
    "If a Servo was ever to use a Consul weapon without orders, a small explosive device implanted in side the Servo would detonate. It's messy.",
    "Servos that are used in combat are at least 20% less likely to be destroyed by their owners than stay-at-home Servos. ",
    "Servos are often used to pilot Skysovereign when on skeleton crew. Its weapons, however, are still manned by trained Consul operatives 24/7.",
    "All factory Servos have a 24 hour limited warranty. If your new Servo arrives broken, incineration and replacement are free of charge.",

    "While Servos do not experience pain, they can experience fear. However, they are unable to express this fear in any meaningful way.",
    "Servo encryption software is very cheap in order to manage the cost of production. Please do not store sensitive information inside Servos.",
    "Simply remove its optical sensors. Servos don't feel pain, so the procedure is literally painless.",
    "Piloting Servos are considered as the machinery driving itself, and are often used as a poorman‘s alternative to Fleetwheel-class vehicles.",
    "Servo Incineration Facilities are conveniently located on nearly every block throughout the city of Ghiripur. Often nextdoor to coffee shops",
    "Servos can occasionally discharge excess Aether as a viscous fluid. Do not touch this fluid unprotected under any circumstances.",
    "Weaponized servos are only a threat to enemies of the state. They will not harm law-abiding citizens unless provoked.",
    "Some success has been found in attaching Servos to powerful weapons. This is outweighed by the fact that these Servos easily tip over.",
    "Inventors use Servos to crash test new, experimental vehicles. A test is successful if the Servo can survive being flung from the wreckage. Most vehicles go through about 20 or 30 tests before one is considered successful.",
    "While it is encouraged to have your malfunctioning Servos scrapped, many small business have arisen to offer Servo repair and customization. This is caused by a Servos programming inherently rejecting modifications, and so crafty inventors can sell modified Servos at a high price.",
    "Servos have no sense of smell or taste, rendering them oblivious to the popularity of autumnal-flavored food and drinks. ",
    "When 2 Servos are created simultaneously, they think of each other as \"siblings.\" An incorrect idea, as Servos have no capacity for family.",

    "Servos make very popular children's gifts. 65% of all scrap Servos were destroyed/mangled by children they were given to.  ",
    "At one time, Servos communicated using a complex series of chirps & whistles. Since that was too cute, they now sound like an alarm clock.",
    "An artificer can use a Servo to improve their combat potential. This destroys the Servo, but since they're not legally alive, no one cares!",
    "While considered disposable, Servos are actually self aware, and have complicated thoughts and feelings.  ",
    "Amongst them selves, Servos are often named Eustace. Most people choose not to acknowledge this fact.  ",

    "The main push-back against Servos being considered \"alive\" comes from the Consul refusing to deal in such petty matters as \"moral quandary\".",

    "Servos have about as much computational brain function as a human infant. Or a monkey, depending on what makes you less uncomfortable.",
    "Thopters whose wings have been damaged are in a legal grey area. They become similar to Servos, but still are legally considered alive.",
    "Many Servos are very insect-like in form, and some mistakenly get destroyed out of fright. Like with insects, no remorse is felt afterwards.",
    "Servos have no recognized form of communication, as they have no speech module, but this hasn't stopped some from trying to be understood.",
    "Thopters were given the legal right to life after it was discovered that they were much harder to mass produce than Servos. ",
    "Thopters, while similar to them in many respects, are importantly distinct from Servos, in that they are instead legally considered alive.",

    "Servos where originally programmed to feel pain when damaged. This was quickly changed to have them feel bliss when damaged. ",
    "Once a Servo is rendered inoperable, it is melted down, to be reshaped into other servos. We understand that modern Servos feel no pain.",
    "The average \"life\" span of a Servo is about 20 minutes, though there has been no record of a Servo malfunctioning without outside influence."
